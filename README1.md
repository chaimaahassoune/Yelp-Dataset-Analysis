However, for a more accurate understanding of the relationship, it is essential to consider the time frame or duration over which these reviews were posted.
   ```sql
select fans , review_count , Name , yelping_since
from user 
order by  fans DESC 
'''

| loveReviews |
+-------------+
|        1780 |
+-------------+

   ```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS hateReviews

## Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

### 1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
#### i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
the 4-5  stars group have less houre than the 2-3 group stars
#### ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
yes they have a deffirent number of review.
####  iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
There is a substantial amount of data available, and we cannot adequately explain or draw conclusions solely from the analysis of these two groups 
SQL code used for analysis:

   ```sql
SELECT 
b.city,
b.stars,
c.category,
h.hours,
b.review_count,
CASE
  WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
  WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
  WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
		WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
		WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
		WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
		WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
	END AS hourDistribution,
    CASE
        WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 Stars'
        WHEN b.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 Stars'
    END AS star_category
FROM 
    business b
JOIN 
    category c ON b.id = c.business_id
JOIN 
    hours h ON b.id = h.business_id
WHERE 
    b.city LIKE 'Las%' AND c.category = 'Restaurants'
GROUP BY stars,hourDistribution
ORDER BY hourDistribution,star_category ASC


### 2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
#### i. Difference 1:
Businesses that remain open typically exhibit a higher average number of reviews compared to those that are closed.
Statistics reveal:

Open businesses: Average review count of 31.757
Closed businesses: Average review count of 23.198

#### i. Difference 2:
Businesses that are open tend to have a higher average star rating compared to businesses that are closed.
here are the statistics:

Open businesses: Average star rating of 3.679
Closed businesses: Average star rating of 3.520

SQL code used for analysis:
   ```sql

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
AVG(review_count),
SUM(review_count),
AVG(stars),
is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
'''
### 3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
#### i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
Predicting the overall star rating for a business

#### ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
It's logical to gauge the overall rating based on service quality, although we lack specific information on this aspect. 
However, leveraging the review_count column could be insightful, assuming that businesses providing excellent service tend to garner more reviews.
Furthermore, analyzing the text column in the review table might help determine whether the presence of words like "hate" and "love" in reviews serves as reliable indicators of the overall rating.
Lastly, cross-referencing these hypotheses with the stars column in the business table would be crucial to confirm or refute our assumptions
#### iii. Output of your finished dataset:
